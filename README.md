# COMPCO867-Software-Engineering-Project

This project is a combination of a React frontend and a .NET backend, using the VSCode extension .vs and mp-app for the frontend and the .NET framework for the backend.

## Frontend

To run the React frontend, use the .vs and mp-app extension in VSCode. The frontend code can be found in the `src` directory.

## Backend

The backend is built with the .NET framework and can be opened using the .sln file in the MEDIC5 directory. The backend code can be found in the `Controllers` and `Models` directories.

## Running the project

1. Open the project in VSCode and start the React development server by running the command `npm start` in the terminal.
2. Open the .sln file in the MEDIC5 directory and run the project in Visual Studio.
3. The project should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`
